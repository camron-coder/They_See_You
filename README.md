## Statment 
---------------
Using sounds and visuals I wanted to evoke a sense of fear in the user. In the first version all I am using is sounds, images, and a particle system to get the user scared/tense. My whole inspiration for this experience is a tutorial I saw on a particle system. When I saw the end result of what the person doing the tutorial had made it did creep  me out a little. But I thought I could make it even creppier by messing with the angle of the articles, the color , how they moved, etc..

Finding the images was a bit of a challenge because im not good with the color masking system. So I had to find some grey scale images and still mess with the color mask to get the images just how I wanted them. I didn't want the images to be static sense the particles aren't static so thats why their position is constantly shifting.

## Installation 
---------------
How would I want this to be experienced? I would have this projected in a small dark room. The user would stand and look at a specific spot and look at the projection.
There would be 2 speakers in front of the user playing an errie music track. There would be 2 more speakers playing some breathing noises. 

## Future plan
---------------
In the future I will add more interaction such as a small interactable sequence in the beginning that the player will have choices to choose between and depending on what they choose they will either get the creppy sequence or something different. I will also add more sounds such as knocking sounds, a couple voice cues, and maybe some thunder
